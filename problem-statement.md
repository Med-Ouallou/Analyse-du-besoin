# Problem Statement

For the **Cultural Tourist**, who struggles to find reliable and centralized information about Fès’s artisanal heritage and modern innovations,  
we aim to create a **blog and multimedia platform** that gathers articles, photos, videos, and interviews of both traditional artisans and modern creators,  
so they can easily discover the city’s artistic history and evolution, even with limited internet access.

For the **Young Fassi Creator**, who lacks visibility and support to connect modern creativity with traditional art,  
we aim to provide an **online space** that promotes collaboration between artisans and innovators, shares creative resources, and builds a local community,  
so they can share, learn, and draw inspiration from Fès’s rich cultural heritage.
